# Data Driven Film Study
 This project aims to provide data-driven insights and recommendations. The primary objectives are to analyse the attributes of top-grossing movies from the past decade, including genre, creative type, production method, release month, and production budget, to determine which factors contribute to high box office performance. Through rigorous analysis, we aim to identify which elements significantly impact a movie's financial success. By extrapolating from this analysis, we intend to offer concrete recommendations specifically tailored to various types of films. Ultimately, our objective is to furnish valuable insights rooted in data to help the target audience make well-informed decisions about entering and/or thriving in the filmmaking business.
